# TODO

#### Bugs
- when trying to load the 3rd snapshot, nothing happens
- bundle d.ts files
  - ami-logger
  - ami-server
- autoplay doesnt resume when set and timeline on the last position
- minimap sometimes shows the previous step
  - eg when going back in time with step type = steps
  - stiil reporo?
- logs scrollbar is forcefully scrolled down even if not at the bottom
- nested transitions are missing the stable-state/between-transitions step
- doesnt work on stackblitz
- switching StepType while Playing
  - causes a scrollTo with the old position value (of the next step)
- switching from LIVE to STATES mixes up the indexes
- not all touched machines drawn on the minimap
- selecting a machine isnt visible
- elements rendered out of the viewport (after layout)
- types missing when using ami-logger in a TS project
- worker dying while selecting a file (modal dialog, eg ios)
  - this.layout_worker.reset - undefined is not an object
- last position of playing doesnt change the button icon to Pause (from Playing)
- rendering out of canvas (use clientWidth for dagre layout consts)
- during Live step type
  - Play button should be grayed out
  - timeline should be scrollable
- uploading snapshots doesnt work on safari
- Cancelled states dont get un-marked
  - repro?
- cant distinguish cancelled from requested
  - during a transition
  - repro?
- sometimes drag-drop on a machine shifts states out of the machines borders
  - when dragging a machine during rendering (but not only)
  - every time in FF
- pipe source state sometimes not marked as touched
- current transitions lacks queue source machine as "involved"
- sometimes machine isnt marked as touched, although listed as Involved
- require highlighted after the target state
  - target state - add - another state, not highlighted as separate steps
- changing the granularity from Transition Steps to States leaves artifacts
  - state_style, is_touched, .during-transition
- scrollbars in both sidebars
  - should have a dark background
- material UI components dont bubble the hotkeys
- jointjs sometimes incorrectly renders links (out of the viewport)
- BUG? step_type == transitions - cancelled transitions not included
- the left sidebar gets repainted when new diff arrives, although the content
  doesnt change
- the worker sometimes times out with debug=3 because of the DiffSync state flooding

#### Inspector
- narrow down timeline steps
  - to those related (touching) a selected machine(s)
- two finger trackpad zoom / out

#### Data service worker
- keep cache in IndexedDB
  - validate by hash
  
#### Logger
- worker pool for jsondiffpatch
  - transfer data using redis / indexedb
  - GC
- optimize creating patches
  - port jsondiffpatch to wasm/rust?
- allow configurable CORS for the server bin
- transaction's source machine (the active queue) should also be marked as touched
- live stream to a file

#### Server
- https support
- support multiple loggers simultaneously

#### Optimizations
- take advantage of canceling async rendering available in the latest jointjs
- cache more stuff
  - `// TODO cache` comments
- send summary as a diff (npm:jsdiff)
- move the canvas rendering to a worker
- preheat jointjs by rendering 10 machines with 10 states each
  - then customize the names with first fullsync
  - always keep a buffor of 5 rendered machines
- extract layout.tsx into separate react components
  - implement custom shouldComponentUpdate
  - reduce re-renders, especially the log and machines view
- optimize jointjs'es render methods
  - drop translate, scale, rotate
  - use x/y coordinates directly from svg
- stream diffsync patches to the DB and throttle notifications to the worker
- start applying styles on the existing nodes
  - while the new ones are still being processed by the requested worker
- eliminate updateRelativeAttributes/getBBox calls in jointjs
  - use translateBy
- keep a merged diff against the full_sync every 100 patches in the exported snapshot
  - reduces scrolling times
  - expand the merged patches to full jsons, in the background
  - create patches between them (to get changed_ids easily)
- cancel rendering in case of the manual scroll position changed
  - MANUAL scroll only
  - dont render the intermidiate frames
- merge deltas instead of re-diffing
  - https://github.com/benjamine/jsondiffpatch/issues/39
- avoid binding to LayoutWorkerReady on every DiffSync
- render only selected machines (helps with big networks)
  - keep the visibility state in the settings
- properly tree-shake asyncmachine as a logger dependency (its type-only)
- cache data service scrolling
  - including next & prev transitions
- move DataService patch scrolling to a separate worker
  - separate from the one dagre layout is in
- network should update the json based on incoming events, not a full rebuild
- react-render sidebars (transitions, machines, logs) only if they are visible
- progressive list rendering for logs
- pre-render N next steps when playing (possibly in a pool of workers)
- longer delay for msgs than for a step they come from
- queue & merge scroll requests while rendering
  - ideally cancel the current rendering
  
#### Refactoring
- migrate to stock workerio
- switch from underscore to lodash
- extract /src/network to a separate module
- update jsondiffpatch
  - pull request the webworker compat
- update to webpack4 / parcel
- divide joint/graph.ts into smaller files
- extract layout.tsx into separate react components
  - implement custom shouldComponentUpdate
  - reduce re-renders, especially the log and machines view
- custom shape constructors (fsa.Arrow etc)
- renderUI() as a state
- rewrite the UI to grid & flex
- divide the UI class into several machines
- merge similar types and UI components
- graph-layout agnostic
  - UI class contains some jointjs structs
  - base class of the DataService needs to be extracted
- use the workerify webpack loader to simplify the build process

#### Graph
- TwoFingers gesture switches to drag scroll anywhere on the surface
- states should have a restriction area of the parent machine
- Transition step type should have 3 steps per transition
  - involved machines are highlighted in all 3 steps
  - 1 before the change, normal state styling
  - 2 involved states highlighted and with the transition styling
  - 3 after the change, normal state styling
  - after & before from different transitions represent the same step
    but are seperate steps on the timeline
  - 0.2s per step?
- visualize if a machine is during transition
  - to distinguish nested transitions
- show the number of ticks in the state's UI
- visualize the number of listeners (per machine)
- visualize if the queue is active (per machine)
- resize a machine
  - requires 'resisable' elements from jointjs
- better colors
- more descriptive transition styles
- 'pipe' isnt exactly like add, nor 'pipe invert' like drop
  - although shown like that

#### Transition Tree
- show transition as a tree
  - every nested transition duplicates the states
  - machines are nodes, states are leafs
  
#### Project
- READMEs for
  - examples
  - npm packages
- more dist forms
  - ES6 modules
    - es6 dist for the browser logger
  - TS files / d.ts
  - source maps
- webpack & typescript deps for the examples
- examples on stackblitz
  - generated state types
  - fixed types generator for merges
- comments in the stackblitz demo file
  - Restaurant class should have a separate target
- short screencasts showing off specific features
  - links to live demos on stackblitz / asciinema
- maybe - extract the cluster graph, worker-based dagre layout for jointjs
  - into a npm module
